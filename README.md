### Credits

The implementation of Fourier phase correlation was derived from the [Stitching ImageJ plugin](https://imagej.net/Image_Stitching).  

However, the code here uses a different method for integrating pairwise stitches to make a global stich, namely a [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree).
